## Movement Provider for Direct Movement
##
## @desc:
##     This script works with the Function_Direct_movement asset to provide
##     direct movement for the player. This script works with the PlayerBody
##     attached to the players ARVROrigin.
##
##     The following types of direct movement are supported:
##      - Slewing
##      - Forwards and backwards motion
##
##     The player may have multiple direct movement nodes attached to different
##     controllers to provide different types of direct movement.
